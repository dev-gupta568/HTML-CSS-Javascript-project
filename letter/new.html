        <div class="first-text">Loving you feels like breathing — natural, effortless, and essential.
You’re not my everything, but you’re the best part of everything I have.
When I look at you, I see calm in the chaos and warmth in the silence.
Your love doesn’t just fill my heart — it teaches it how to beat.
You make the simplest moments feel unforgettable. </div>
        <div class="second-text">There’s something rare about the way you make the world softer.
You don’t light up my life — you make me want to keep it glowing.
Every time I think of you, it feels like the world exhales. </div>
        <div class="third-text">You’re not a dream — you’re the reason I stopped searching for one.
With you, love doesn’t feel like a story — it feels like home.
Some people bring adventure; you brought peace, and I think that’s the real magic.  </div>
        <div class="fourth-text">In the garden of my heart, you’re the most beautiful flower.
The stars envy the sparkle in your eyes.
When you smile, the whole universe pauses to adore you.</div>
        <div class="fifth-text">I didn’t believe in forever until I met you.
You make ordinary moments feel magical.
My favorite place in the world will always be next to you.</div>
